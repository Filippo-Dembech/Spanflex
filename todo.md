# Todo

- feature: set the value of the user span when clicking on `Countinue` in tutorial page
- fix: align `Can't Remember` button with `SpanInputs` buttons





- save user parameters into local storage
- add icons to `Increase Span` and `Retry` buttons
- fix scrolling problem:
  - In the tutorial page in the mobile view when the user clicks on `Continue` the new page slides in in the same position without going back to the top, in this way the user has to scroll up again to read
